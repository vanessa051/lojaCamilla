    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>Instra Corporation is a company based in Melbourne, Australia. Formed in 1997, Instra Corporation has expanded its initial Domain Name business from New Zealand and Australia into a leading, world-wide Domain Registrar.</p>

    <p>We supply domain names in 250 countries worldwide and have direct accreditations with over 60 Registries. Many companies and household brand names from around the world take advantage of Instra’s unique and sophisticated “Reseller portal” to actively manage their online intellectual property. Our customers come from over 200 different countries.</p>

    <p>Instra® is active in ensuring we are constantly providing our customers with new domain name spaces, and are regularly updating our domain name offering from around the world. Instra® is first in ensuring we offer our valued corporate customers with knowledge about new spaces that are becoming available and the Registry processes required to secure these domain names.</p>

    <p>For more than 130 years, Intertek’s story has always been about innovation. In 1885 we began testing and certifying grain cargoes before they were put to sea, and in 1888 we pioneered the idea of independent testing laboratories. Then in 1896, the greatest inventor of them all became part of our story. When Thomas Edison released the wonders of electricity and the light bulb he wanted to ensure that his products were checked, tested and safe. He established the Lamp Testing Bureau, later to become the Electrical Testing Laboratories.</p>
